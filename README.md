# Pet Master
IOS Program for people with pets
This is the program for IOS, where you can save information about your pets: images, vaccinations, events, diseases and food (in future).
This can be very helpful, when you go to a vet, to a shop to buy food or simply make plans for a future to make haircut, to visit vet, etc.,
because this app will notify you about all you plans with your pet!
